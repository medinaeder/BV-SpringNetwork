##############
Most Important
Reshape the bolei output the right way. See what the data says this way
Compare the data with the other implementations

###########
The preprocessing that is done for the grid2dgraph is going to be different than the hexagonal and the triangular lattice graph

Finish the proper implementation of the static case
Need to compare the output of the generalized graph to the output of the bolei graph

Label Boundary Nodes
Figure out how to apply the boundary conditions on the nonlinear problem

Compare to the finite difference jacobian


We don't have a input output module..

# Perhaps we can use the sparse lu
# Convert the dense to a sparse matrix and then use superlu
# can always can go back and check

Create the best plot
Compute the jacobian of this system

# Add a plotting routine
