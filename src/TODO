Need to compare the output of the generalized graph to the output of the bolei graph

Label Boundary Nodes
Figure out how to apply the boundary conditions on the nonlinear problem
Compute the Jacobian

We don't have a input output module..

# Perhaps we can use the sparse lu
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.splu.html

Reshape the bolei output the right way. See what the data says this way
Create the best plot
Compute the jacobian of this system
