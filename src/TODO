Finish the StaticSolver
# Generalizations that are needed
o: Labeling Boundary Nodes

# General Questions
o: What does an input output module look like

# on an 8x8 with only a few solutions the forward solve takes about
# 3 minutes
# Doesn't seem to bad but we need to figure out how to create all the right logging files etc

# DONE:
# Important checks that have be completed
x: ecked the Jacobian with the finite difference approximation
x: Interpret the eigenvalues of the jacobian
x: The eigenvalues are all real! This is good

x: Plotting
